I’ll be honest, the thought scares me. So much of my future is unknown, who knows where I’ll end up? But if there’s one thing that I know for sure, it’s that I’ll always have the people that I’ve met through Pi Sigma Epsilon. "

Professionally and academically, I’ve never been surrounded by a group of people that has shown more passion, determination, and support for one another. From sharing notes to helping each other mock interview, there’s always someone that wants you to succeed as much as you do.This is why Pi Sigma Epsilon has produced some of the most successful people that I know. From bankers to consultants to engineers, each person has and will accomplish so much. But beyond these successes, what truly makes Pi Sigma Epsilon special is the people. From buying last minute Coachella tickets to being vulnerable for the first time to simply cooking ramen and Korean rice cakes together, these memories with my brothers are what will stick with me for years after college is over. These are the people that have taught me how to embrace who I am, how to fail and get back up, how to be the best version of me. They make me better, and that is something that can’t be found anywhere else. "

Come out to our Fall Recruitment 2019 to meet the 40 active brothers that have made UC Berkeley so special for me, and can do the same for you. Turn the person who you’ve always wanted to be into the person that you are, surrounded by the people you call family. "
